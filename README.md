## ðŸ”§ Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features
- Complete authentication flow with phone number validation
- Responsive dashboard with statistics and activity feed
- Full keg assignment workflow with QR scanning
- Complete keg collection system with progress tracking
- Comprehensive driver profile with statistics
- Consistent design system and component library

### ðŸš§ Mock Data & Backend Integration Points
The app currently uses mock data for demonstration. Backend integration points include:

1. **Authentication API**: Login validation and session management
2. **Driver Data API**: Personal information and statistics
3. **Outlets API**: Available outlets and their keg inventory
4. **Keg Management API**: Assignment and collection operations
5. **Activity Feed API**: Recent actions and notifications

### ðŸ“‹ Backend Integration Checklist
- [ ] Replace mock authentication with real API calls
- [ ] Implement real-time data synchronization
- [ ] Add offline capability with local storage
- [ ] Integrate push notifications for assignments
- [ ] Add GPS tracking for route optimization
- [ ] Implement photo capture for delivery confirmation
